estimated less than 120% AMI in this target geography for purposes of determining Area Benefit eligibility for NSP.  From Census 2000.

From Census 2000. To qualify for area benefit under CDBG, the target area needs to be 51% or more LM.\n","\n","'USPS_ADD' USPS count of addresses for the identified area in March 2010.  Note that this address count is based on a Census Tract address count that is assigned to Block Group parts based on the HU2007 variable above.  Note that if the address count is significantly different from the HU2007 variable above, users are advised to use this information with caution.  For example if there are many NoStats in an area for units never built, the USPS residential address count may be larger than the Census number; if the area is a rural area largely served by PO boxes it may have fewer addresses than housing units.     \n","\n","'USPS_VAC' USPS data on addresses not receiving mail in the last 90 days as of March 2010.  This can be a useful measure of whether or not a target area has a serious vacancy problem.  For urban neighborhoods, HUD has found that neighborhoods with a very high number vacant addresses relative to the total addresses is a very good indicator of a current or potential serious blight problem.  This number has been adjusted to reduce the count of vacancies due to vacation rentals.\n","\n","'USPS_NS' USPS “NoStat” indicator.  This variable can mean different things.  In rural areas, it is an indicator of vacancy.  However, it can also be an address that has been issued but not ever used, it can indicate units under development, and it can be a very distressed property (most of the still flood damaged properties in New Orleans are NoStat).   When using this variable, users need to understand the target area identified.\n","\n","'HMDA' Home Mortgage Disclosure Act count of primary mortgages executed between 2004 and 2007 Note that this mortgage count is based on Census Tract level data that is assigned to Block Group parts based on the HU2007 variable above.\n","\n","'HC_RATE' Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data showing the percent of primary mortgages executed between 2004 and 2007 that were high cost.  **This is the Census Tract level rate.**\n","\n","'SDQ_RATE' The estimated rate of mortgages Serious Delinquent (90+ or more days delinquent or in foreclosure) in June 2010.  \n","\n","'STARTS' Estimated number of foreclosure starts in the target area in the past year.\n","\n","'REO' Estimated number of completed foreclosures in the target area in the past year.\n","\n","'IMPACT' Estimated number of properties needed to make an impact in identified target area.  There is not magic to this number, it is presuming that a minimum of 20% of REO in a target area would need to be addressed to make a visible impact.  The purpose of this variable is to encourage grantees to select target areas that are small enough so that their NSP investment has a chance of stabilizing a neighborhood.\n","\n","'PRICECHG' Metropolitan Area (or non‐metropolitan area balance) percent fall in home value since peak value (Federal Housing Finance Agency Home Price Index through June 2010).
